# MDB
MDB is a project that uses [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to let users search for a movie and get some information about it. 
The user searches a movie title and the app fecthes information and the movie poster from the server.
It's developed based on MVC architecture and some common design patterns like Delegation and Memento are used in it.

# How to use
